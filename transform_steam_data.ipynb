You're too late and it's just not worth it.  I'm sorry.\\n\\nFor the seldom few who have had this game a long time and have loads of cash, the game is fun and still playable (if it wasn't crashing every 10 minutes). The base game has great potential and R* has put forth an effort to expand the experience.  Unfortinately, the cost of this is cripplyingly expensive.  The equivalent of 1000hrs of grind time might get you to a place where you can finally sit back and enjoy yourself for a bit, but you'll still be relatively broke.  It makes no sence.  The game is clearly milking its base for all it's worth and stomps on those that disrupt their income.\\n\\nIt'd be nice if R* could move on, but GTAV is easy money.\\n\\nHonestly, the only way you will not regret your purchase is if R* gives up on the modders and cash starts raining from the sky (literally).  And so long as they fix the crashing, you could have a blast.  The conversion rates on the Sharkcards are criminal.\\n</td>\n",

Online started out as being fun with friends, but turned into a cash cow with nothing but little kids with their parent’s credit card murdering you with expensive vehicles. I thought of online as a RP game, but now it is just garbage. The developer quit adding dlc items into story mode and the only way to obtain them is mods. Story mode doesn't sell \"Shark Cards\" so naturally they wanted to quit supporting it and force players into online. All those hours grinding to buy the things I wanted online quickly lost to the pay to win players who had everything always had an unfair advantage. Most of the game is online play now.\\n\\nStory Mode = I Recommend \\nOnline = I don’t recommend\\n\\nThey shutdown what I considered one of the biggest modding DLCs, LIberty City in  V.

Almost stellar single player campaign, good story, good gameplay, very good graphics (very sharp, especially in 4K).\\n\\nMULTIPLAYER:\\n---------------------\\n\\nAnd now the BAD side starts, the ugly one.\\n\\n-Multiplayer (GTA Online) SUCKS - Full of hackers, bots which apparently cannot be controlled by R* which implies that R* doesn't have a good anti-hacker / anti-bot support, this whole s**t falls on them.\\n-Other than endless (not-fun) farming in GTA Online there's pretty much nothing else to do except suffer the wrath of hackers.\\n-The heists become stale and boring after a few runs. They're only 5 in number so there's only so much you can repeat something. AFAIK they did said something about adding new heists along the \"lifetime\" of GTA V but that never happend we're just getting boring online DLCs.\\n-Oh and don't even get me started on Shark Cards... I mean really?! For 8mil$ you ask for 75eur?! Are you out of your mind R*?! It costs more than the ACTUAL g****mn game!\\n-And the d**n loading screens, endless, unending loading screens... No matter how fast your PC is tthe loading screens are here to stay, endlessly looking into your soul.\\n\\nThis is to the \"DUDES\" at R* and Take-Two:\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-And lastly the whole OpenIV ordeal which to me looks way beyond ugly what R* and Take-Two did. \\nI mean come'on, what the f**k did you (R* and Take-Two) think was going to happen? You thought the gaming community would just sit with open arms and watch as YOU destroy a whole modding community just because YOU want ?!\\nDid you even check how CD-Projekt Red handles Witcher 3? How they handle their whole gaming business? THAT'S HOW YOU HANDLE GAMING IN LIFE - Like CD Projekt Red does. \\n\\nFollow their example and you might actually have a chance at doing something good for the gamers and gain their respect.\\n\\nGuess f*****g what Sherlock? I won't buy ANTYHING EVER from R* and Take-Two even if it's GTA 6,7,8 etc.\\n\\nMy two cents.\\n\\nLE: Looks like the community won and OpenIV is back in business but that doesn't change my stance on the ugliness R* and Take-Two did.

You're too late and it's just not worth it.  I'm sorry.\\n\\nFor the seldom few who have had this game a long time and have loads of cash, the game is fun and still playable (if it wasn't crashing every 10 minutes). The base game has great potential and R* has put forth an effort to expand the experience.  Unfortinately, the cost of this is cripplyingly expensive.  The equivalent of 1000hrs of grind time might get you to a place where you can finally sit back and enjoy yourself for a bit, but you'll still be relatively broke.  It makes no sence.  The game is clearly milking its base for all it's worth and stomps on those that disrupt their income.\\n\\nIt'd be nice if R* could move on, but GTAV is easy money.\\n\\nHonestly, the only way you will not regret your purchase is if R* gives up on the modders and cash starts raining from the sky (literally).  And so long as they fix the crashing, you could have a blast.  The conversion rates on the Sharkcards are criminal.\\n   \n",

Online started out as being fun with friends, but turned into a cash cow with nothing but little kids with their parent’s credit card murdering you with expensive vehicles. I thought of online as a RP game, but now it is just garbage. The developer quit adding dlc items into story mode and the only way to obtain them is mods. Story mode doesn't sell \"Shark Cards\" so naturally they wanted to quit supporting it and force players into online. All those hours grinding to buy the things I wanted online quickly lost to the pay to win players who had everything always had an unfair advantage. Most of the game is online play now.\\n\\nStory Mode = I Recommend \\nOnline = I don’t recommend\\n\\nThey shutdown what I considered one of the biggest modding DLCs, LIberty City in  V.

       "1377764  A long time has passed since my initial positive review but this time around I'll give a negative one.\\n\\nSINGLE-PLAYER:\\n------------------------\\n\\nSo, regarding the GAME itself, it is good. Almost stellar single player campaign, good story, good gameplay, very good graphics (very sharp, especially in 4K).\\n\\nMULTIPLAYER:\\n---------------------\\n\\nAnd now the BAD side starts, the ugly one.\\n\\n-Multiplayer (GTA Online) SUCKS - Full of hackers, bots which apparently cannot be controlled by R* which implies that R* doesn't have a good anti-hacker / anti-bot support, this whole s**t falls on them.\\n-Other than endless (not-fun) farming in GTA Online there's pretty much nothing else to do except suffer the wrath of hackers.\\n-The heists become stale and boring after a few runs. They're only 5 in number so there's only so much you can repeat something. AFAIK they did said something about adding new heists along the \"lifetime\" of GTA V but that never happend we're just getting boring online DLCs.\\n-Oh and don't even get me started on Shark Cards... I mean really?! For 8mil$ you ask for 75eur?! Are you out of your mind R*?! It costs more than the ACTUAL g****mn game!\\n-And the d**n loading screens, endless, unending loading screens... No matter how fast your PC is tthe loading screens are here to stay, endlessly looking into your soul.\\n\\nThis is to the \"DUDES\" at R* and Take-Two:\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n-And lastly the whole OpenIV ordeal which to me looks way beyond ugly what R* and Take-Two did. \\nI mean come'on, what the f**k did you (R* and Take-Two) think was going to happen? You thought the gaming community would just sit with open arms and watch as YOU destroy a whole modding community just because YOU want ?!\\nDid you even check how CD-Projekt Red handles Witcher 3? How they handle their whole gaming business? THAT'S HOW YOU HANDLE GAMING IN LIFE - Like CD Projekt Red does. \\n\\nFollow their example and you might actually have a chance at doing something good for the gamers and gain their respect.\\n\\nGuess f*****g what Sherlock? I won't buy ANTYHING EVER from R* and Take-Two even if it's GTA 6,7,8 etc.\\n\\nMy two cents.\\n\\nLE: Looks like the community won and OpenIV is back in business but that doesn't change my stance on the ugliness R* and Take-Two did. The damage has been done already.   \n",
